# Avaritia
Avaritia is the Latin term for greed.

So, this game will be an RPG with a very indepth currency system.

The system will include features such as:

*Buildings(Such as houses, merchant stalls, etc...; Will also have MANY upgrades to each building type)(Build your waifu a mansion!)

                                                                            (Almost like a tech tree)

*Royalty(Some NPCs may have this stat which makes them wealthy from birth)(All hail the Queen!)

*Jobs(Each job will have a tech tree type promotion system)(Started from the bottom, now we here!)
