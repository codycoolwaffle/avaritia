# Avaritia
Avaritia is the Latin term for greed.

So, this game will be an RPG with a very indepth currency system.

The system will include features such as:

*Buildings

    (Such as houses, merchant stalls, etc...; Will also have a tech tree like upgrade system)
    (Build your waifu a mansion!)

*Royalty

    (Some NPCs may have this stat which makes them wealthy from birth)
    (All hail the Queen!)

*Jobs

    (Each job will have a tech tree type promotion system)
    (Started from the bottom, now we here!)
